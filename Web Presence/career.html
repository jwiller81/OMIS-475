        <h3 class="habout">Interest</h3>     
        <p>When it comes to career, I am very interested in both the IT and data analysis fields. Within this field I am very interested in learning new coding languages for both. For example, I would like to learn Python, R, and C++. As for where I would like to work and where I am interested, I would be happy to land a position anywhere looking to hire. Later on in my career, these interests may change based off of previous experience.</p>

                <h3 class="habout">Goals</h3>     
                <p>When it comes to career, I only have come up with a few goals that I want to achieve. Once I work more in the position, I will be able to add more goals to this section. As for now, the only goals that I can say I would like to achieve is who I work for in the future. My dream has always been to work for the any major Chicago sports team. I would love to do analytics revolving around player performance, quite similar to the movie “Moneyball”. However, I wouldn’t also mind working IT or data analysis on the business sides of these organizations. </p>
