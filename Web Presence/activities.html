        <p>I was on the football team for all four years. With no previous play experience, I started my freshmen year more as a learner than anything else. Once Sophomore year came around I was promoted to Captain of the team. That season I played both wide receiver on offense and safety on defense. All season long, I never touched the sideline as I was also involved on special teams. Junior year was more lack luster, as most juniors didn’t start and only relieved senior starters. By my senior year, I was the starting wide out receiver. Unfortunately, after week one I suffered a fractured L5 in my lower back. Even with a six-week recovery time, I managed to work my way back on the field by week 6. Football gave me memories that will last a lifetime and I will always be thankful of the game.  </p>

        <h3 class="habout">Track</h3>    
        <P>Just like football, I was involved with Track all four years at Niles West. I was on the sprints team, and I ran the 100m, 200m, and 400m races. Sometimes I would also run these same races but for relay style. After months of training, senior year turned out to be my best season of them all. I started the season as Captain and went on to earn the number one spot on the team for the 200m dash. At our first outdoor meet, I dropped four wins in the 100m dash prelims, 100m dash finals, 200m relay, and the 400m relay. As a team we went on to win the invitational, and with my performance I was awarded the invitational plaque at the end of the season. In our final conference meet, I was able to squeeze my way into contention for all-conference. Sure enough, I was awarded with all-conference later that week, joining just a small few. Track was and is something I’m still very proud of. </P>

        <h3 class="habout">Dodgeball</h3>  
        <p>Shortly after my arrival at NIU, I found myself joining the club dodgeball team. Dodgeball met once a week and was a way for me to continue staying active in a competitive sport. I quickly adapted to the game, using both skills that I learned from football and track. Dodgeball has been a great way for me to let off some steam after hardships with school. In my junior year at NIU, I was voted President of the club dodgeball. For the 2017-2018 year, I was in charge of all club operations and managed over 70 members. This past year I stepped down from Presentient to play the game and just enjoy it. Dodgeball was a great way for me to meet new people while I was in a new environment. I met a lot of people through the club and have made friends that I will have for a long time cause of it. </p>
