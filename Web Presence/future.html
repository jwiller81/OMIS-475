        <h3 class="habout">Life after NIU</h3>
        <p>Once I graduate this May, life starts to change moving forward. Currently, I am still looking to obtain a position in either a data analysis role or an information systems role. Either way, I hope to find something before graduation, if not I will still continue to look until I find something. After living in DeKalb for four years, I do plan on moving back to the suburban area. I’m not sure exactly where yet, but hopefully anywhere between Naperville and Niles.</p>

        <h3 class="habout">What I plan to accomplish in 5 years</h3>    
        <P>In five years, I hope my career is finally starting to pick up. I would like to see myself in some sort of analytics/IT position working for the same firm for more than two years. I also am holding it to myself to learn Python within the next five years as well. By this point in my life, I am hoping I’m married and getting ready to start a family. Whether this plays out, remains to be seen, but it would be nice to see myself start to mature into the next steps of life.</P>

        <h3 class="habout">What I plan to accomplish in 10 years</h3>    
        <P>As for ten years from now, I hope to see myself in a senior analysis role working for a big organization. The crazy sports fan that I am, would love to have an opportunity with the Chicago Blackhawks, Bears or Cubs. You can get more information about this on my Career Interest page, but I would enjoy having the opportunity to run analysis for these teams. Outside of career, I hope to expand a family with two or three kids.</P>

        <h3 class="habout">Where I hope to live</h3>  
        <p>The living situation remains up in the air at the moment, as stated previously. I do not have plans of leaving Illinois anytime soon. I am very active in looking for a job in the suburbs or city of Chicago. As for the future, I plan to stay in that area. I’ve lived in Illinois my whole life so far, and I don’t look for that to change. All of my family lives here, and I would love to start a family here. Time will only tell, but other circumstances would make myself reconsider this decision. </p>
