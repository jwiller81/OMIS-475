    <p>Welcome to my Website, my name is Jeff Willer! I currently am a Senior at Northern Illinois University majoring in Operation Management and Information Systems and minoring in Data Analytics. I am set to graduate in May 2019 and still looking for a position in either information systems or data analytics. I was born on December 18th, 1996, so I currently am 22. I am very passionate about technology, sports, and family. My goal with this website is to show not only myself, but employers the skills I have achieved with HTML and CSS.

    <h3 class="habout">Upcoming Events</h3>
    <p class="scrolldiv"> In the next few months, there will be some events occurring in my life that I would like to touch on. As of right now, my schedule is jam packed with school work. I currently am set to have a major project due at the end of the semester, which will be the creation of a new web page. Following that, I have a capstone paper and presentation to present in our strategic management class. Then, starting May 6th I will have three finals, in three separate classes. Upon completion of these finals, I will be set to graduate at the NIU Convocation Center on May 11th. I do hope to go on several Job interviews during all of this to try to achieve my goals of finding a position within the IT/Data analysis fields. So, hopefully I can put down the start of a new job in this upcoming events section. Other events, not related to school, are a graduation party, moving back to the suburbs, and visiting family over the summer. All of these events mentioned in the summer will be given dates in the foreseeable future.</p>
