                <h3 class="habout">High School Experience</h3>    
                <P>Throughout high school, I was very active with sports. From freshmen year to senior year, I was involved in football and track. I was a student-athlete and proud of it. As well, in high school I was also very active in my classroom setting. By the end of high school, I had finished with a 3.0 GPA. It wasn’t the best, but I was always satisfied with how much work and effort I put in. Being an athlete at Niles West was one of the greatest accomplishments I have achieved in life so far. Many great athletes have been born at Niles West including: George Kontos, Rashard Mendenhall, and Jewell Loyd. Being apart of this school's traditions and expectations really made high school some of my best moments yet.</P>

                <h3 class="habout">College Life</h3>  
                <p>After high school ended, I was on my way to Northern Illinois University. By August 2015, I began my first semester at NIU. Nervous and ready to learn, I strived to be a better student in college than what I did in high school. I knew how important college was, and I didn’t want to be average at it. Through many hardships, I learned to be a better student, as well as a better person. With my focus on information systems and data analytics, I truly saw how right of a fit it was for me. I’m proud to say that I currently have a major GPA of a 3.5, along with my minor in data analytics. As well, I accomplished making Dean’s List in the Fall of 2018.</p>
