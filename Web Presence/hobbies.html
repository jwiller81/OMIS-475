        <p>In my free time, I always love playing or watching sports. Since I was five years old, I have always been playing some sort of sport. When I was growing up I played baseball and basketball. Like previously mentioned on other pages, I also played football and ran track in high school. Even today, I still enjoy going out and throwing a baseball or football around with friends and family. This has always been a way for me to destress when my life is getting hard. It also gives me chances to take in the beauty of the great outdoors. However, I am not just a fan of playing sports, I am also a fan of watching them. I was born a Chicago Cubs fan and became a Chicago Bears fan not too long after. By the time I was in my early teenage years, I also got into the sport of hockey. As you could probably figure out, I am a Chicago Blackhawks fan too. Sports have always been a huge part of my life. There is nothing more enjoyable to me than watching the Bears play on Sundays or watching the Cubs at Wrigley Field. </p>

    <P>Unlike most people, I also started playing video games at the age of five. In my spare time, I enjoy sitting down and grinding video games out. Nothing screams to me more than a game with a good story or multiplayer experience. You also can include my other interest into this category also. Sports games are just as fun for me, especially because I get to use my own fantasies with team, player, and roster customizations. They always served as rivalry night in my household as my brother and myself would always compete one-on-one in these games. As of right now, the games I currently am fixated on are: Rainbow Six Siege, Madden 19, Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey, and Star Wars Battlefront 2. Along with these games, I do all my gaming on PlayStation consoles. I grew up on PlayStation and have had all their consoles. I currently own the and play all my games on the PlayStation 4.</P>
