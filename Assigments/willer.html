        <dt><i><strong>Sports</strong></i></dt>
        <dd>One of my favorite activities/hobbies is watching and playing sports. Ever since I was five years old I've been active in playing sports. I started off with baseball and slowly made my way to basketball, football, and track. In my spare time I love being active and playing these sports on a daily basis. I also enjoy watching these sports on TV. Whenever I have time I enjoy watching the Chicago Bears, Blackhawks, and Cubs play. </dd>
        <dt><i><strong>Video Games</strong></i></dt>
        <dd>At the age of six, I started playing video games. My love expanded and ever since my passion for gaming has grown. I've always played a wide variety of games from racing to role playing to shooters. My top five favorite games right now are Rainbow Six Siege, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, NHL 19, Call of Duty WWII, and Star Wars Battlefront 2.    
        <dt><i><strong>Movies</strong></i></dt>
        <dd>Whenever I am not doing one of these two hobbies, I can usally be found watching movies. I've always been a huge fan of action films and comedy films. My all time favorite movie would have to be Avengers Infinity War, but I assume Avengers End Game will surpass it this April.
