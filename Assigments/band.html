<h4>Top 3 favorite Linkin Park CD releases!</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i><strong>Meteora</strong></i></dt>
<dd><i><strong>Meteora</strong></i> is one of the best albums to be released by Linkin Park. It released in the year 2003, and held many popular hits such as: "Somewhere I Belong", "Lying from You", "Hit the Floor", "Faint, and Numb". All of these songs were songs I used to listen to before track meets and football games. To this date, <i><strong>Meteora</strong></i> still ramains one of my favorite albums that Linkin Park released. If I had to give this album a rating I would give it a solid 9.5/10.</dd>
<dt><i><strong>Minutes to Midnight</strong></i></dt>
<dd><i><strong>Minutes to Midnight</strong></i> was a well structured album, but it wasnt as good as <i><strong>Meteora</strong></i>. Even though it didn't match up to <i><strong>Meteora</strong></i>, it still was a solid album. It's 2007 release was a great gift to fans who had waited so long since the 2003 album. Some of their top songs from this album were "What I've Done", "Bleed It Out", "Given up", and "Leave Out All the Rest". It really seemed like this album digressed from their <i><strong>Meteora</strong></i> album. However, if I had to give the album a rating it earned a good 8.5/10. </dd>
<dt><i><strong>A Thousand Suns</strong></i></dt>
<dd><i><strong>A Thousand Suns</strong></i> followed the pattern of most modern day rock bands during that time. Most bands began intertwining rock with almost a techno or EDM feel. At this point, the album was releasing in the fall time of 2010. My favorite songs from this album included "The Catalyst", "Waiting for the End", "Burning in the Skies", and "Iridescent". This album gave a new feel to Linkin Park's music and set the tone for their future albums and changed the overall dynamic of modern day rock. <i><strong>A Thousand Suns</strong></i>, compared to the previous two albums matched up just as evenly. Rating this album, I would give them a 8/10. </dd>
